# Week3
For this week's activity, you will review and complete the script attached below. This script reviews the basic preliminary functions that you read about in week 1. Where you see the word "TASK", you need to complete the code.
#This code chunk identifies my working directory 
#and sets it to where I want to save and fetch files
#TASK: fill in between the parentheses if needed. 
#If not needed, make the two lines a comment
#getwd()
#setwd()

#This brings the 'Titanic' data into my environment from Base R (Run this)
Titanic

#This code saves the Titanic data as a dataframe with a new name
#TASK: Save the Titanic data as a dataframe with a new name that includes your first name
#for example I would name my data AnnaTitanic
SilviaTitanic <- data.frame(Titanic)

#This code chunk allows me to see the top 2 rows of my data
#TASK: Write the code that returns the top rows
install.packages("dplyr")   # This installs the package
library(dplyr)              # This loads the package for use in the current R session
slice(.data = SilviaTitanic, c(1:2))


#This code chunk shows me the internal structure 
#Task: Write the code that shows the number of rows, columns, column names, class of columns   
nrow(x = SilviaTitanic)
ncol(x = SilviaTitanic)
names(SilviaTitanic)
sapply(SilviaTitanic, class)


#This code chunk shows me some basic summary stats
#Such as Min, Max, Mean. Quartiles...
#Task: Write the code that gives summary stats
summary(SilviaTitanic)

#This allows me to save one column as its own object ('values' in the Environment)
#Task: Write the code to create an object for just the Sex column 
#and write the code to create an object for just the Age column 
#(these should show as values in the environment window, not as 'datasets'Data')
Sex_Object <- SilviaTitanic$Sex
Age_Object <- SilviaTitanic$Age

#This takes the individual objects ('values' in the Environment) and creates a dataframe
#Once I do this, I can see the Data in the Environment 
#Task: Write the code to create one new data.frame from the Sex and Age values you just created
new_dataframe <- data.frame(Sex = Sex_Object, Age = Age_Object)

#This code chunk creates a subset from my dataset
#Note that the subset only appears in the Console (not the Environment)
#Task: Write the code to create a subset of the data where the Freq is > 25
#If I wanted to save the subset, I would need to name it as done in the code above
subset_Titanic <- subset(SilviaTitanic, Freq > 25)

#This shows me how many rows are in my dataset and
#TASK: Write the code that returns the number of rows
nrow(x = subset_Titanic)

#This shows me how many columns are in my dataset
#TASK: Write the code that returns the number of columns
ncol(x = subset_Titanic)

#This also shows me how many rows and columns with just one command
#TASK: Write the code that returns the number of rows and columns with just one command
dim(subset_Titanic)

#This code will install the ggplot2 package
#TASK: Write the code that installs the ggplot2 package
install.packages("ggplot2")  
  
#This code calls the ggplot2 package so I can use its functions
#Task: Write the code that 'calls' the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

#This code creates a bar chart of the number of passengers that survived 
#and did not survive (2 bars)
#Task: replace the dataframe name and column names to create the chart
#(you should see the chart in the Plots window)
ggplot(SilviaTitanic, aes(Survived)) +
  geom_bar()
